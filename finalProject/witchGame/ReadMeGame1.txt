 Fly a witch through the course using the arrow keys. 
 The goal is to try and stay alive as long as possible.
 The only issue I've encountered with the game
 is that when it plays on a screen the up and down arrows 
 move the person and the screen this will hopefully 
 be fixed in future update. I just need to resolve some 
 of the code with kiki and the canvas.
